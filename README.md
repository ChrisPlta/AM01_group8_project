Group 8's Project

In their data analysis, group 8 looked at the weekly sales data of 45 stores of a US retailer. Additionally, we were provided with information on contextual data, such as the consumer price index or temperatures in the region, and more detailed information on the stores.

In our approach, we started with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to clean and better understand the data. Through graphing correlations and distributions, we started to investigate what the relationships between variables might be. It proved espexcially tricky to work with the distribution of weekly sales data, as it was strongly skewed.

Next, we conducted inferential statistics, most signficiantly wanting to understand how holidays would affect sales for the stores. While it seems that most major holidays and events, such as the super bowl, do not significantly affect weekly_sales (based on a 95% CI), Thanksgiving does indeed seem to be a time a year for a retaielr to look forward to. The mean was signficantly different for that week as compared to non-holiday weeks.

Last but not least, we sought to create a model to determine how the different predictive variables would affect sales. Through an iterative process, we create 7 different models, finally arriving at an acceptable level of RÂ² adjusted. We are confident that the model can provide some insights of how different variables affect the retailers sales.
